                <p>Bottom Line: The film will bring back the magic for your t(w)een, who was a fan of the original. But, it could be too intense for preschoolers. There are some spoilers below in the full review. Full Review: While it had some great songs, and I thought better instrumental music, I still like the music from the original better. The reprise of "Into the Unknown" at the end of the movie is sung by Panic! At the Disco - clearly meant to appeal to the original Frozen fans, who are now tweens and teens.</p>

                <p>Do watch ‚úÖ #TomAndJerryMovie preferably with ur kids. It deliver what it promises üëâüèº üëâüèºrekindle ur childhood nostalgia of the iconic cartoon characters!! ‚ù§Ô∏è
                    It also gives the kids a chance to enjoy the celebrated slapstick comedy of the famous cat and mouse duo! üòòü•∞
                    Mind you, the movie does not offer any ‚Äúsoul‚Äù enriching message like SOUL nor any sensational songs/music that you can‚Äôt ‚Äúlet it go‚Äù like Frozen. Instead it plays off the strength of the eternal frenemies putting them against a live action backdrop, giving them tech upgrades including smartphones, selfies ü§≥, Instagram, drones, skateboards with built-in WiFi etc. to keep up with the changed times.
                    The movie brings back almost the full gang - Spike the bull dog, Goldie the goldfish, Butch the unfriendly alley cat, shoulder Devil üëø/ shoulder Angel üòá of Tom etc. including few other cartoon characters who appear in cameo such as the Elephants, Peacocks, Pigeon (narrator) etc. But I missed Jerry‚Äôs cousin Muscles, the Tweety bird üòç
                    The movie attempts to recreate some of the iconic scenes from the original cartoon series such as Tom turning into a flying bat, getting hit on face with hot ironing box, Spike chasing Tom with his devilish tooth, Tom planning the piano and Jerry troubling him and few others.
                    If I were to point out some negatives, then I‚Äôd say the animation for Tom and Jerry although of better quality visually, does feel out of place at times especially because you‚Äôre wired in your brains to see them in a certain way (like you saw them in the original series when animation was not so advanced). But you‚Äôll overlook this once you get engrossed in the movie.</p>

An international team of scientists writing in the journal Global Change Biology say the number of active fires in August was actually three times higher than in 2018 and the highest number since 2010.</p>
